    <!-- Until now, we are using onClick event listener, 
    but we are using it inline to HTML element. 
    <button onClick="likeMe()">Like👍</button>
    - But this method of adding event is not recommended, since we are writing JS inside HTML tags.
- So, to improve this, we have a method called as **`addEventListener()`**
- The `addEventListener()` method attaches an event handler to a document, same functionality as onClick,it’s
  just a syntax change. -->
