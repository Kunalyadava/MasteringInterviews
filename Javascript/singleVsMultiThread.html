    ### Comparison of **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python** in Terms of **Single-threading**, 
    **Multithreading**, **Concurrency**, and **Parallelism**:

When comparing **JavaScript**, **Java**, and **Python**, it's crucial to understand the 
different ways they handle **single-threading** and **multithreading** and how they 
implement **concurrency** and **parallelism**.

### 1. **Single-threading**

**Single-threading** refers to the ability of a programming language or runtime to execute 
tasks one at a time in a single sequence of instructions. A single thread processes one task after another.

#### **JavaScript**:
- **Single-threaded by default**: JavaScript (in the browser or Node.js) runs on a single 
thread for execution. This means that only one task can be executed at any given moment in the JavaScript runtime.
- **Event Loop**: JavaScript uses an **event loop** to handle asynchronous tasks 
(like I/O operations). While JavaScript itself is single-threaded, asynchronous 
operations (e.g., setTimeout, Promises, async/await) allow non-blocking behavior, giving the illusion of concurrency.

**Example**:
```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Task 1 completed");
}, 2000);

console.log("End");
```
**Output**:
```
Start
End
Task 1 completed
```
- JavaScript executes the tasks sequentially, but the asynchronous `setTimeout` 
doesn't block the thread. It schedules the callback function to run after 2 seconds, 
allowing the "End" message to be logged before the timeout.

#### **Java**:
- **Multithreaded by default**: Java is a **multithreaded** programming language 
and provides built-in support for creating multiple threads of execution. 
This means that Java programs can run tasks in parallel by leveraging multiple threads.
- **Thread API**: Java provides an API for working with threads, allowing 
for manual control of concurrent execution, thread management, and synchronization.

**Example**:
```java
public class SingleThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Start");
        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);  // Simulate delay
            System.out.println("Task 1 completed");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println("End");
    }
}
```
**Output**:
```
Start
Task 1 completed
End
```
- Java executes the code sequentially within the main thread. While Java can handle multithreading 
(i.e., multiple tasks at once), this example executes everything on a single thread.

#### **Python**:
- **Single-threaded by default**: Python (with CPython, the default Python implementation) 
also runs as **single-threaded** by default.
- **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**: Python’s GIL prevents multiple native threads from executing 
Python bytecode in parallel. However, I/O-bound tasks can still be run concurrently using 
threading or asynchronous programming.

**Example**:
```python
import time

def task1():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Task 1 completed")

print("Start")
task1()
print("End")
```
**Output**:
```
Start
Task 1 completed
End
```
- Python runs tasks sequentially here, similar to the Java example. The `time.sleep` 
call simulates a blocking task. However, due to the GIL, Python cannot execute multiple 
threads concurrently for CPU-bound tasks.

### 2. **Multithreading**

**Multithreading** allows a program to execute multiple tasks concurrently using multiple threads of 
execution. Threads can run in parallel (if there are multiple CPU cores), or they can be 
interleaved on a single core (context switching).

#### **JavaScript**:
- JavaScript is **single-threaded by default**, but it can achieve **multithreading** through 
**Web Workers** (in browsers) or **Worker Threads** (in Node.js).
- These separate threads run independently of the main thread, enabling multithreading, 
although they communicate with the main thread via message-passing (postMessage).

**Example (Web Workers in JavaScript)**:
```javascript
// main.js
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage('Start task');
worker.onmessage = function(event) {
    console.log('Message from worker:', event.data);
};

// worker.js
onmessage = function(event) {
    let result = `Processed: ${event.data}`;
    postMessage(result);
};
```
- **Web Workers** run in a separate thread and can handle tasks in parallel. 
The worker does not block the main thread.

#### **Java**:
- Java has built-in **multithreading** support through its `Thread` 
class and the `ExecutorService` framework.
- Threads can be executed in parallel on separate CPU cores, making 
Java an ideal language for multithreaded and concurrent applications.

**Example (Multithreading in Java)**:
```java
public class MultiThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> System.out.println("Task completed");
        
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(task);
        
        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```
- The two threads `thread1` and `thread2` can run concurrently or 
in parallel depending on the system’s CPU capabilities.

#### **Python**:
- Python supports **multithreading** via the `threading` module.
- However, due to the **GIL**, threads in Python do not execute **in parallel** 
for CPU-bound tasks. They can only run **concurrently** (interleaved) on a single core. 
For **true parallelism**, Python uses the **multiprocessing** module.
  
**Example (Multithreading in Python)**:
```python
import threading

def task1():
    print("Task 1 completed")

# Create two threads
thread1 = threading.Thread(target=task1)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=task1)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()

thread1.join()
thread2.join()
```
- The threads run concurrently but are still limited by the GIL for CPU-bound tasks.

### 3. **Concurrency**

**Concurrency** is the ability to manage multiple tasks at once. It does not necessarily 
mean that tasks are executed simultaneously, but that the system can switch between tasks 
(e.g., in the case of I/O-bound tasks) to improve efficiency.

#### **JavaScript**:
- JavaScript handles **concurrency** using the **event loop**, callbacks, and **Promises**.
- Although JavaScript is single-threaded, it allows **asynchronous programming** that 
can handle multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread.

**Example (Concurrency with Async/Await in JavaScript)**:
```javascript
async function task1() {
    console.log("Start task 1");
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 2000));  // Simulating async task
    console.log("Task 1 completed");
}

console.log("Start");
task1();
console.log("End");
```
- Even though `task1` is asynchronous, the program doesn't block other tasks from executing. 
It logs "Start" and "End" without waiting for `task1` to complete.

#### **Java**:
- Java supports **concurrency** via threads and the **`ExecutorService`** framework.
- You can run multiple tasks concurrently, with Java managing the scheduling and execution of these tasks.

**Example (Concurrency in Java with ExecutorService)**:
```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class ConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        Callable<String> task = () -> {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
            return "Task completed";
        };

        Future<String> future = executor.submit(task);
        System.out.println(future.get());  // Blocks until task is done
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```
- Here, the task runs concurrently, and the main thread waits for its 
result using the `future.get()` method.

#### **Python**:
- Python provides **asynchronous concurrency** using the `asyncio` module or 
`threading` (for I/O-bound tasks).
- Since Python uses the GIL for thread management, concurrency works well 
for **I/O-bound tasks**, but not for CPU-bound tasks.

**Example (Concurrency in Python with asyncio)**:
```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Start task 1")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate async I/O task
    print("Task 1 completed")

async def main():
    print("Start")
    await task1()
    print("End")

asyncio.run(main())
```
- The `task1` function is asynchronous, allowing for other tasks to 
run while waiting for the I/O operation (like sleeping).

### 4. **Parallelism**

**Parallelism** is the execution of multiple tasks simultaneously, usually on 
separate processors or cores. In contrast to concurrency, parallelism 
involves actual simultaneous execution of tasks.

#### **JavaScript**:
- JavaScript can achieve **parallelism** using **Web Workers** (in the browser)
 or **Worker Threads** (in Node.js).
- These separate threads run independently and can perform tasks in parallel.

#### **Java**:
- Java provides built-in support for **parallelism** through multithreading, 
where tasks are executed on multiple threads, potentially on multiple CPU cores.

**Example (Parallelism in Java with Streams)**:
```java
import java.util.stream.IntStream;

public class ParallelismExample {
    public static void main(String[] args

) {
        int sum = IntStream.range(1, 1000000)
                           .parallel()   // Use multiple threads for parallelism
                           .sum();
        System.out.println(sum);
    }
}
```
- The `parallel()` method ensures the task is divided into multiple threads, 
utilizing multiple CPU cores.

#### **Python**:
- Python can achieve **parallelism** using the `multiprocessing` module. 
This bypasses the GIL and runs processes in parallel on separate CPU cores.
- For CPU-bound tasks, Python uses multiple processes to achieve true parallel execution.

**Example (Parallelism in Python with Multiprocessing)**:
```python
import multiprocessing

def task1():
    print("Task 1 completed")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    processes = []
    for _ in range(2):
        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=task1)
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```
- The tasks are executed in parallel on separate processes, 
taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.

### **Summary: Which Languages Are Single-threaded or Multithreaded?**

- **Single-threaded languages**: 
  - **JavaScript**: Traditionally single-threaded in its main execution context 
  (e.g., browser or Node.js). However, it can use Web Workers and Worker 
  Threads to simulate multithreading and parallelism.
  
- **Multithreaded languages**: 
  - **Java**: Fully multithreaded by design. It supports multithreading 
  and parallelism natively.
  - **Python**: Technically **multithreaded**, but the Global Interpreter 
  Lock (GIL) prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks. 
  For parallelism, Python uses the `multiprocessing` module.
