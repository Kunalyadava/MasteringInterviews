### Overview of Angular Files and Folders

#### 1. **Introduction**

In this lecture, we are going to have a quick overview of the Angular files and folders that get generated when we first
create an Angular project. We will understand the use of each of them briefly. Whenever we create a new Angular project
using the Angular CLI, it generates a bunch of files and folders inside the project directory. For example, if the
project directory is named `angular-ecart`, it will contain various files and folders generated automatically by the `ng
new` command. Each of these files and folders serves a specific purpose in the project.

#### 2. **Node Modules Folder**

The `node_modules` folder is where all the third-party libraries and packages are stored. These libraries are downloaded
from npm and are essential for the application's development. This folder is not meant to be deployed to the production
server or included in the repository. For instance, if you use Git as your version control system, you will exclude the
`node_modules` folder when pushing your project code to the repository. This folder is purely for development purposes.

#### 3. **Node Modules and Version Control**

You might wonder how the application will work without the `node_modules` folder when it is not included in the
repository or during deployment. Letâ€™s say a team member checks out the project from the repository where the
`node_modules` folder is not present. The application will not function as the required dependencies will be missing. In
such cases, you simply open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the `npm install` command. This
command reads the `package.json` file, identifies the required dependencies, downloads them, and recreates the
`node_modules` folder.

#### 4. **Package Management**

The `package.json` file plays a critical role in dependency management. It contains a list of all the packages the
Angular project depends on. When you run `npm install`, the command uses this file to fetch and install the necessary
libraries and packages. Even if the `node_modules` folder is deleted, you can restore it by executing this command,
ensuring that all dependencies are available for the project.
