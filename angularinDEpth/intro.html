### **Section 1: Introduction to Angular**
Hello and welcome to the very first lecture of this complete Angular course. In this course, you're going to learn
everything about Angular step by step without skipping any topic, and let's kickstart this course by having a brief
overview of what Angular actually is. Angular is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building client-side
applications, and it provides a lot of reusable code, like predefined methods, classes, interfaces, etc., which we can
use to create dynamic client-side applications. Generally, we use Angular for creating single-page applications. So, in
this lecture, we are going to learn what Angular is, what a single-page application is, why you should use Angular, and
what are the different versions of Angular available. Angular is a development platform for building single-page
applications for mobile and desktop. We use Angular for building client-side applications using HTML, CSS, and a
programming language like TypeScript or JavaScript.

### **Section 2: Understanding Framework and Single-Page Applications**
So, remember that Angular is not a programming language in itself, like JavaScript. Instead, it is a framework that uses
programming languages like JavaScript or TypeScript. So, we can say that Angular is a JavaScript framework that allows
us to create single-page applications. Now, in this definition, there are two points to note. First of all, Angular is a
JavaScript framework; it is not a programming language, it is a framework. And second, we use Angular for creating
single-page applications.

A framework is like a platform for developing software applications. A framework can have predefined classes and
functions that can be reused to perform and add several functionalities, which otherwise we would have to write from
scratch by our own. For example, let's say we are creating a client-side application where we are using JavaScript as
the client-side programming language. Now, from this application, we want to make an HTTP request to the server and then
we want to get some response from the server. Since we are using plain JavaScript as the programming language, we are
not using any framework here. In order to achieve this, we will have to write the logic of making an HTTP request to the
server from scratch, and we will also have to test whether that logic is working properly or not in different scenarios.
But if we use a framework like Angular, it already provides predefined classes and methods for making an HTTP request to
the server. These classes and methods are already tested and verified, so we need not worry about that stuff. Also, in
simple words, a framework is a collection of predefined classes and methods which provide APIs for performing different
operations when used in an application, and Angular is one such framework. It provides classes and methods which we can
reuse in our application instead of writing them from scratch.

### **Section 3: Single-Page Applications Explained**
Now, let's try to understand what a single-page application is, but before that, let's understand how a typical web
application works. So, here we have a client and a server. From the client, we make a request to the server for a
particular resource. In this example, we are making requests to the server for getting the HTML of the about resource.
The server will send us the HTML of the about page, in this case, about.html. If we request the contact page, the server
will return contact.html in the response.

Let's try to understand this with a simple example. So, let's say we have a very simple web application, and currently,
we are on the home page. In the URL, you can see the resource is /home. The client has made a request to the server
requesting the HTML of the home page, and the server sent this home.html to the client, which is rendered by the client.
In this case, this home.html has been rendered by the browser. Now, if I navigate to the about page, you see the URL
changes to /about. The client again makes a request to the server for the HTML of the about page, and in the response,
we have received about.html that is rendered by the client. If I go to the courses page, again, a request will be sent
to the server requesting the HTML of the courses page, and that HTML will be sent by the server to the client, which
will be rendered.

This is how a typical web application works, but this is not how a single-page application works. A single-page
application is an application that has only one HTML page, and a perfect example of a single-page application would be
Gmail and Netflix. In a single-page application, when we navigate around the application, the URL seems to change, but
the actual HTML page never changes. The content of that page changes dynamically with JavaScript.

### **Section 4: Advantages of Single-Page Applications**
In a single-page application, when we navigate around the application, it will seem like we are visiting different
pages. It will look like different HTML documents are requested from the server and loaded in the browser, but in
reality, the HTML page never changes. Only the content of that HTML page changes. The content is changed by JavaScript
dynamically.

Whenever we are navigating around, we are not requesting any data from the server. JavaScript is simply changing the
content based on the resource we have requested. Since we are not making any requests to the server each time we request
a new resource, you will never see the refresh icon spin.

The advantage of a single-page application is that it is much faster because we are not repeatedly reaching out to the
server to request a new piece of HTML data every time we navigate to a different URL. This allows for the creation of
fast and reactive applications, just like mobile applications. If you need data from the server, you can load it in the
background without making the web page unresponsive, and once the data is loaded, you can display it in your
application.

### **Section 5: Why Use Angular for Web Development?**
Now, you might wonder, why do we need a framework like Angular for this? Can't we just use JavaScript or jQuery to do
the same thing? Yes, we can, but as the application grows, it becomes harder to maintain vanilla JavaScript or jQuery
code. It becomes complex, and we need a proper way to structure the application. Many applications built using vanilla
JavaScript or jQuery are hard to test, and some functionalities need to be written from scratch.

This is why frameworks like Angular have been developed to make web application development easier. Angular provides
several benefits for developing applications compared to vanilla JavaScript or jQuery. It gives the application a
loosely coupled structure that is easy to understand and maintain. It also brings in a lot of utility code, which can be
reused in many applications, especially when dealing with user navigation and the browser's history. Applications built
with Angular are more testable, allowing us to easily write automated tests for various parts of the application.

### **Section 6: Evolution of Angular and Versions**
Now, let's understand the different versions of Angular. One thing that can be confusing when learning Angular is the
versioning of Angular. It all started in October 2010 when the first version of Angular was released, and it was called
AngularJS. This version of Angular was completely different from the Angular we use today. AngularJS was created as a
JavaScript framework for building client applications. It gained popularity but was not designed with the needs of
today's applications in mind. Moreover, it was overly complex.

In 2016, the Angular team decided to rewrite the original framework from scratch using TypeScript and named it simply
"Angular" instead of AngularJS. This version was called Angular 2. Angular 2 was completely different from AngularJS and
fixed many of the issues of AngularJS. AngularJS is hardly in use anymore.

Since the release of Angular 2, there have been several other versions of Angular, such as Angular 4, 5, 6, 7, and so
on. By the time this video was recorded, the latest version of Angular is Angular 16. After the release of Angular 2,
the Angular team adopted a versioning scheme where a new version of Angular is released every 6 months. These new
versions are typically not completely rewritten but include minor changes or new features.

### **Section 7: Conclusion**
So now, we have two kinds of Angular: AngularJS, which is the first version of Angular, and Angular (starting from
version 2 and later). In this course, you will learn about Angular 2 and later versions, and not AngularJS. Whatever you
learn in this course will also apply to the latest versions of Angular.

This was a high-level overview of what Angular is, why you should choose Angular, and the different versions of Angular.
In the next lecture, let's go ahead and create our very first Angular project.
