An interpreted language is one that does not require compiling into machine language.
 It is executed by an interpreter who reads the source code and converts 
 it into a form that is directly executed. The interpreter executes code 
 line by line which makes JavaScript synchronous in nature.

Languages like C, and C++ need a compiler that converts the programs into a bytecode
(Bytecode is computer object code that an interpreter converts
 into binary machine code so it can be read by a computer's hardware processor.)
 which is then executed by a machine, compiler executes the complete program at one time,
  which increases the execution speed whereas JavaScript doesn’t need a compiler; 
  it is directly executed by the browser which interprets the program 
  instruction by instruction. Since the interpreter is executing the program 
  instruction by instruction, this leads the slower execution.

  TypeScript
  Typescript is a strongly typed object-oriented compiled language. It was developed by Microsoft.
  Code written in TypeScript first needs to get compiled and then converted to JavaScript. This process of conversion is known as Transpilation.
  TypeScript supports modules, hence it allows modular programming.
