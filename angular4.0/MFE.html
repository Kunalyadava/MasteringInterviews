        <p>
          Microfrontends is an architectural approach where a web application is
          divided into smaller, independently developed, and deployed frontend
          applications or "micro-apps." This allows teams to work on different
          parts of a frontend project in parallel and deploy them separately,
          which increases flexibility and scalability.

        <h2>Webpack Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Webpack is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler that is
          widely used in modern web development. Its primary role is to take
          multiple modules (files) with dependencies and bundle them into one or
          more optimized files that can be loaded by a browser. Here’s a
          breakdown of what Webpack does and why it’s important:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Modules and Bundling</h3>
        <!-- Web applications are typically built from multiple JavaScript, CSS,
        HTML, and image files. Webpack treats each file as a module. When you
        import one file into another (like importing a JavaScript module),
        Webpack creates a dependency graph to understand the connections between
        these files. Webpack then bundles these modules into a single (or a few)
        optimized JavaScript files, which reduces the number of requests the
        browser needs to make, speeding up page load times. -->
        <p>
          Webpack treats each file (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, images) as a
          <strong>module</strong> and bundles them into optimized output files,
          reducing the number of network requests for improved performance.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Entry and Output</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Entry:</strong> The starting point for Webpack to build the
          dependency graph.<br />
          <strong>Output:</strong> The final file(s) that Webpack generates
          after bundling all modules.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Loaders</h3>
        <p>
          Webpack uses <strong>loaders</strong> to transform files before
          bundling them. Examples of loaders include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>css-loader</code> for processing CSS files</li>
          <li>
            <code>file-loader</code> for managing images and other file types
          </li>
          <li><code>babel-loader</code> for transpiling modern JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Plugins</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Plugins</strong> enhance Webpack’s functionality by handling
          tasks like code optimization and managing assets. Examples include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code>HtmlWebpackPlugin</code>: Generates an HTML file that includes
            the bundled JavaScript.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>MiniCssExtractPlugin</code>: Extracts CSS into separate files.
          </li>
          <li><code>TerserPlugin</code>: Minifies JavaScript files.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Development and Production Modes</h3>
        <p>
          Webpack has two modes: <strong>development</strong> for fast builds
          and debugging, and <strong>production</strong> for optimized, smaller
          bundles.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Code Splitting</h3>
        <p>
          Webpack allows <strong>code splitting</strong>, breaking the bundle
          into smaller chunks that are loaded only when needed, improving
          initial load times.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Tree Shaking</h3>
        <p>
          Tree shaking eliminates unused code from the final bundle, making the
          output more efficient.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Module Federation</h3>
        <p>
          Module Federation allows different applications to share and load code
          at runtime, which is a key feature for implementing microfrontends.
        </p>

        <h2>Micro Frontends: Mono Repo vs Multi Repo</h2>
        <p>
          When building Micro Frontends, the code organization and management
          are key factors. Two main strategies are used: Mono Repo and Multi
          Repo.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Mono Repo</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>Mono Repo</strong> stores all microfrontends and shared code
          in a single repository. This setup makes it easy to manage shared
          components, dependencies, and builds.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Easy dependency management, centralized
            CI/CD, and shared tooling.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenges:</strong> Scalability issues and versioning
            complexities as the project grows.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Multi Repo</h3>
        <p>
          A <strong>Multi Repo</strong> strategy uses separate repositories for
          each microfrontend. This approach allows teams to work autonomously on
          different MFEs.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Benefits:</strong> Independent versioning, releases, and
            autonomy for teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenges:</strong> Harder dependency management and
            potential code duplication across MFEs.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="note">
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Choosing between Mono Repo and Multi Repo
            depends on factors like team size, project scale, and the need for
            shared or independent development workflows.

    The image shows the text "MICROFRONTEND with Module Federation - a feature
    of Webpack 5." ### Explanation - **Microfrontend**: Microfrontends is an
    architectural approach where a web application is divided into smaller,
    independently developed, and deployed frontend applications or "micro-apps."
    This allows teams to work on different parts of a frontend project in
    parallel and deploy them separately, which increases flexibility and
    scalability. - **Module Federation**: Module Federation is a feature
    introduced in Webpack 5 that enables the sharing of modules across separate
    builds. This means different applications (or microfrontends) can
    dynamically load and use modules from each other at runtime. Module
    Federation makes it easier to implement microfrontends by allowing parts of
    one app to be reused in another without rebuilding the entire application. -
    **Webpack 5**: Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript
    applications. In Webpack 5, Module Federation was introduced as a new
    feature, enabling better support for microfrontend architectures by
    facilitating the sharing and integration of modules across separately
    deployed applications. In summary, the image highlights that "Microfrontend
    with Module Federation" is a feature of Webpack 5, enabling a modern
    approach to frontend development with improved modularity and integration.


    Webpack is a popular open-source JavaScript module bundler that is widely used in
    modern web development. Its primary role is to take multiple modules (files) with
    dependencies and bundle them into one or more optimized files that can be loaded by a browser.
    Here’s a breakdown of what Webpack does and why it’s important:

    ### 1. **Modules and Bundling**
    - Web applications are typically built from multiple JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and image files.
    - Webpack treats each file as a **module**. When you import one file into another (like importing
    a JavaScript module), Webpack creates a dependency graph to understand the connections between these files.
    - Webpack then **bundles** these modules into a single (or a few) optimized JavaScript files,
    which reduces the number of requests the browser needs to make, speeding up page load times.

    ### 2. **Entry and Output**
    - **Entry**: The entry point is the main file Webpack starts with when it builds the dependency graph.
    This is typically the main JavaScript file (e.g., `index.js`) where the application begins.
    - **Output**: Webpack combines all the modules and dependencies into a final file (or files)
    known as the output. This output is then loaded by the browser when a user accesses the application.

    ### 3. **Loaders**
    - Webpack itself can only handle JavaScript by default, but modern web projects include other types of files, like
    CSS, images, and TypeScript.
    - **Loaders** are plugins that let Webpack process these different file types, allowing you to import them just like
    JavaScript modules. For example:
    - `css-loader` allows you to import CSS files.
    - `file-loader` handles files like images.
    - `babel-loader` processes JavaScript with Babel to enable support for modern JavaScript syntax.
    - Loaders are powerful because they enable Webpack to transform and optimize non-JavaScript files alongside
    JavaScript.

    ### 4. **Plugins**
    - **Plugins** extend Webpack’s functionality beyond bundling. They can perform various tasks, such as optimizing
    bundles, managing assets, and injecting environment variables.
    - Some commonly used plugins include:
    - **HtmlWebpackPlugin**: Automatically generates an HTML file with the bundled JavaScript included.
    - **MiniCssExtractPlugin**: Extracts CSS into separate files rather than bundling them directly into the JavaScript.
    - **TerserPlugin**: Minifies JavaScript to reduce the file size of the bundle.

    ### 5. **Development and Production Modes**
    - Webpack provides different **modes** (development and production) to make configuration easier:
    - **Development mode**: Focuses on quick build times and readable output (source maps, etc.) to help with debugging.
    - **Production mode**: Focuses on optimizations, like minification and tree-shaking, to make the final bundle as
    small as possible for faster loading.

    ### 6. **Code Splitting**
    - Webpack supports **code splitting**, which allows you to break down your bundle into smaller pieces or "chunks."
    This way, only the necessary parts of the application are loaded at first, improving initial load times.
    - **Lazy loading** is a common use case for code splitting. For example, parts of the application can be loaded only
    when needed (like when a user navigates to a certain page).

    ### 7. **Tree Shaking**
    - Tree shaking is a technique Webpack uses to remove unused code from the final bundle.
    - By analyzing the dependency graph, Webpack identifies code that is not being used (dead code) and excludes it from
    the final bundle, making the output smaller and more efficient.

    ### 8. **Module Federation**
    - Introduced in Webpack 5, **Module Federation** allows different applications (or microfrontends) to share modules
    and code with each other in real-time.
    - This feature is useful for **microfrontend architectures**, where different teams or parts of a project can
    develop, deploy, and update parts of a web application independently while still sharing common modules or
    components.

    ### Why Webpack is Useful
    - **Optimized Bundles**: Webpack creates optimized bundles, resulting in faster loading times and improved
    performance.
    - **Asset Management**: By allowing you to import and process various file types, Webpack simplifies managing assets
    like CSS, images, and fonts.
    - **Modularity**: Webpack’s module-based approach aligns well with modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular,
    and Vue.
    - **Development Tools**: Webpack has many plugins and loaders that enhance development efficiency, like hot module
    replacement (HMR) for real-time updates during development.

    ### Summary
    Webpack is a powerful tool for modern web applications, helping to bundle, optimize, and manage dependencies and
    assets. It supports a modular architecture, enhances loading efficiency, and provides tools to build maintainable
    and performant web applications.

    In the context of Micro Frontends (MFE) using Angular, the terms **Mono Repo** and **Multi Repo** refer to how the
    code for different micro frontends (and possibly shared components) is organized and managed within a version
    control system (e.g., Git). Let's break them down:

    ### 1. **Mono Repo (Monorepo) in Micro Frontends**
    A **Mono Repo** refers to a single repository where the code for all micro frontends (MFEs) and possibly other
    shared resources (like libraries or utilities) are stored in one central place.

    **Key Characteristics of a Mono Repo:**
    - **Single Repository for All MFEs:** All the micro frontend applications, shared libraries, and components exist in
    the same Git repository.
    - **Shared Code and Dependencies:** Since all MFEs are in one repo, they can easily share code, utilities, and
    components. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistent versions across all MFEs.
    - **Centralized Build System:** Typically, a build tool (like **Nx**, **Lerna**, or **Angular CLI** with workspace
    support) is used to manage builds, tests, and deployments across different MFEs.
    - **Code Collaboration:** Developers working on different MFEs can collaborate easily since they all work in the
    same repository.

    **Benefits:**
    - **Easier Dependency Management:** Shared libraries can be updated in a single place, and version mismatches are
    avoided.
    - **Consistent Development Practices:** Common tooling and code style can be enforced across MFEs, as they are all
    part of the same codebase.
    - **Centralized CI/CD Pipeline:** A unified pipeline for building, testing, and deploying all the MFEs.

    **Challenges:**
    - **Scalability Issues:** As the project grows, the repo can become large and harder to manage. Build times might
    also become longer if not properly optimized.
    - **Complex Versioning:** While shared code is easy to manage, tracking versions of different micro frontends might
    become tricky, especially if each micro frontend has different release schedules.

    **Example Tools for Mono Repo:**
    - **Nx** (commonly used for Angular projects)
    - **Lerna**
    - **Angular CLI Workspaces**

    ### 2. **Multi Repo in Micro Frontends**
    A **Multi Repo** strategy means that each micro frontend (MFE) is stored in a separate, independent repository. This
    approach is based on the idea of decoupling each frontend into its own standalone codebase.

    **Key Characteristics of a Multi Repo:**
    - **Separate Repositories for Each MFE:** Each micro frontend is developed, versioned, and deployed in its own Git
    repository.
    - **Loose Coupling:** Each MFE is fully independent, which means different teams can work on different MFEs with
    minimal interference.
    - **Independent Deployments:** Each micro frontend can be deployed independently, which is one of the key benefits
    of the micro frontend architecture.

    **Benefits:**
    - **Independent Versioning and Releases:** Each MFE can have its own release cycle and versioning scheme, which
    makes it easy to deploy them independently.
    - **Decoupled Teams and Development:** Different teams can focus on different MFEs without being impacted by others,
    and each MFE can have its own set of dependencies.
    - **Flexible Technology Stack:** Since each MFE is in its own repo, teams can choose to use different versions of
    Angular or even completely different frontend frameworks (e.g., React or Vue.js) if needed.

    **Challenges:**
    - **Code Duplication:** Shared components and libraries might need to be duplicated across multiple MFEs, which can
    lead to version mismatches and duplication of effort.
    - **More Complex Dependency Management:** Managing dependencies between MFEs becomes harder, and you might need a
    central package manager (like **npm** or **yarn workspaces**) or a tool to synchronize versioning across the repos.
    - **Harder to Manage Integration:** Since each MFE is in a separate repo, integrating and testing them as part of a
    larger application becomes more complex.

    **Example Tools for Multi Repo:**
    - **Git Submodules** (for including other repos)
    - **GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, etc.** (to handle CI/CD across multiple repos)
    - **Bit.dev** (for managing shared components across repos)

    ### Choosing Between Mono Repo and Multi Repo for Micro Frontends in Angular

    **When to use a Mono Repo for MFEs:**
    - If you have a relatively small team and want to share a lot of common code across your micro frontends.
    - If you want a single build system and deployment pipeline for all your MFEs.
    - When you prioritize consistency in dependencies, tooling, and versioning.

    **When to use a Multi Repo for MFEs:**
    - If your micro frontends are developed by independent teams that need to have full autonomy over their codebase.
    - If the micro frontends need to be deployed and updated independently, without any coordination between teams.
    - If the size of your project or team grows to the point where managing everything in a single repository would
    become cumbersome.

    ### Conclusion
    - **Mono Repo** is generally preferred when you have a centralized control structure, want consistency in code and
    tooling, and need to share code and dependencies easily across MFEs.
    - **Multi Repo** is useful when you need more autonomy for each MFE, want independent deployments, or have very
    large teams working on separate frontends that should not interfere with each other.

    In practice, many teams using Angular for micro frontends often start with a Mono Repo approach because it
    simplifies sharing code, but as the number of MFEs grows and the teams become more distributed, the transition to a
    Multi Repo setup can also make sense.
