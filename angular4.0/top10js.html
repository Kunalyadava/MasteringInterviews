    1. Closures
A closure is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope, even when the function is executed
 outside that scope. In other words, a closure allows a function to access variables from 
 its outer function after the outer function has finished executing.

Example of a Closure:
<script>
function outer() {
  let count = 0;  // `count` is a local variable to `outer`

  return function inner() {
    count++;  // `inner` function has access to `count` from `outer`
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counter = outer();  // `outer` is invoked, returning the `inner` function
counter();  // Output: 1
counter();  // Output: 2
</script>
Here, the function inner is a closure because it continues to have access to 
the count variable defined in its outer function outer, even after outer has
 finished execution. Each time counter is called, it increments count because it
  "remembers" the environment in which it was created.

2. Prototypal Inheritance
In JavaScript, prototypal inheritance allows objects to inherit properties and methods
 from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a prototype, which is another object 
 from which it can inherit properties and methods.

Example of Prototypal Inheritance:
<script>
// Define a prototype object
const animal = {
  speak: function() {
    console.log("Animal speaks");
  }
};

// Create a new object that inherits from `animal`
const dog = Object.create(animal);
dog.speak = function() {
  console.log("Dog barks");
};

dog.speak();  // Output: Dog barks
</script>

In this example, dog inherits the speak method from animal, but we override it 
with a new version in the dog object. This is an example of inheritance in JavaScript,
 where an object inherits behavior from another object.

3. Asynchronous Programming (Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await)
Asynchronous programming allows the execution of code without blocking the main thread. 
This is especially useful for operations like I/O (reading files, fetching data) that may take time.

Callbacks
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed later,
 usually once a task is completed.
<script>
function fetchData(callback) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Data fetched!");
    callback();
  }, 1000);
}

fetchData(() => {
  console.log("Callback executed");
});
</script>
In this example, fetchData simulates fetching data, and the callback function is executed once 
the data is "fetched" (after 1 second).

Promises
A promise represents the result of an asynchronous operation, which can either be fulfilled 
(successful) or rejected (error).

<script>
function fetchData() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
    }, 1000);
  });
}

fetchData().then((data) => {
  console.log(data);  // Output: Data fetched!
});
</script>
In this case, fetchData returns a promise that resolves after 1 second, and .then 
is used to handle the resolved value.

Async/Await
async and await simplify working with promises. async makes a function return a promise, and await 
pauses the execution of the function until the promise resolves.

<script>
async function fetchData() {
  const data = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve("Data fetched!");
    }, 1000);
  });
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();  // Output: Data fetched!
</script>
await pauses execution at the promise, and once it's resolved, the value is returned.

4. Higher-Order Functions
A higher-order function is a function that either accepts other functions as arguments or 
returns a function as its result.

Example of a Higher-Order Function:
<script>
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  const name = "Alice";
  console.log(callback(name));  // `callback` is a higher-order function
}
</script>

processUserInput(greet);  // Output: Hello, Alice!
In this case, processUserInput is a higher-order function because it accepts another function 
(greet) as an argument and calls it within its body.

5. Memoization
Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up functions by storing the results of 
expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

Example of Memoization:
<script>
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return function (arg) {
    if (cache[arg]) {
      return cache[arg];
    }
    const result = fn(arg);
    cache[arg] = result;
    return result;
  };
}

function slowFunction(n) {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  return n * 2;
}

const memoizedFunction = memoize(slowFunction);

console.log(memoizedFunction(5));  // Output: Calculating... 10
console.log(memoizedFunction(5));  // Output: 10 (cached result)
</script>
The first time slowFunction(5) is called, it computes the result and stores it in the cache. 
On subsequent calls with the same argument, it simply returns the cached result.

6. Modules (Import/Export)
Modules in JavaScript allow you to break up your code into smaller, reusable pieces.
 You can use import and export to share code between different files.

Example of Import/Export:
<script>
// math.js
export const add = (a, b) => a + b;
export const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;

// app.js
import { add, subtract } from './math.js';

console.log(add(2, 3));  // Output: 5
console.log(subtract(5, 3));  // Output: 2
</script>
In this example, math.js exports the add and subtract functions, 
and app.js imports them and uses them.

7. Dynamic Import()
Dynamic imports allow you to import modules asynchronously at runtime, which can be useful 
for code splitting and reducing the initial load time of a web application.

Example of Dynamic Import:
<script>
button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const { greet } = await import('./greet.js');
  greet();
});
</script>
Here, the greet.js module is imported only when the button is clicked, rather than at the start of the application.

8. Shadow DOM and Web Components
The Shadow DOM is a browser feature that allows you to encapsulate a section of the DOM,
 so styles and scripts inside it don't affect the rest of the page.

Web Components are a set of standards that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements.

Example of Shadow DOM:
<script>
const div = document.createElement('div');
const shadow = div.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
shadow.innerHTML = `<p>Inside Shadow DOM</p>`;
document.body.appendChild(div);
</script>
The content inside the shadow DOM is isolated from the main document's styles and scripts.

9. Event Loop and Concurrency Model
The Event Loop is a fundamental part of the JavaScript concurrency model. It allows JavaScript
 to perform non-blocking operations by putting functions into a queue and executing them asynchronously.

How the Event Loop Works:
Call Stack: Where functions are executed.
Event Queue: A queue of events (such as mouse clicks or HTTP responses) waiting to be processed.
Web APIs: Provide non-blocking functionality like setTimeout, fetch, etc.
The event loop continuously checks if the call stack is empty and then processes the events in the queue.

10. Currying
As discussed earlier, currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple 
arguments into a series of functions that each take one argument.

Example of Currying:
<script>
function multiply(a) {
  return function(b) {
    return a * b;
  };
}

const multiplyBy2 = multiply(2);
console.log(multiplyBy2(5));  // Output: 10
</script>
Here, the function multiply is curried, and we create specialized functions like multiplyBy2 
that can be reused with different arguments.
