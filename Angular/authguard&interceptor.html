// authGuard Example:
<script.ts>
  export const authGuard: CanActivateFn = (route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, state: RouterStateSnapshot) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");

  if (!token) {
  // If user is not authenticated, redirect to login page and save intended URL
  const returnUrl = state.url;
  console.log(`User attempted to access ${returnUrl} without authentication. Redirecting to login.`);
  router.navigate(['/login'], { queryParams: { returnUrl: returnUrl } });
  return false;
  }

  // If user is authenticated, allow access to the route
  return true;
  };
  </script>
  <!-- In this example:

We check if the user has a valid token stored in localStorage.
If not, we redirect the user to the login page and pass the 
intended URL as a query parameter (returnUrl), which can be
 used later to redirect the user back to the original destination after login.
If the user is authenticated, we allow access to the route.

    <b>Summary:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>CanActivate:</b> Checks if a route can be activated, typically used for authentication.</li>
      <li><b>CanActivateChild:</b> Checks if a child route can be activated, useful for nested routes.</li>
      <li><b>CanDeactivate:</b> Checks if a route can be exited, often used to prevent loss of unsaved changes.</li>
      <li><b>CanLoad:</b> Checks if a module can be loaded, useful for lazy-loading and access control.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Each of these guards can be implemented to return an Observable<boolean>, Promise<boolean>, or a boolean, depending on whether the check is synchronous or asynchronous. 
      These guards help manage navigation flow and ensure users interact with the application in a controlled manner.

                                  <!-- The !! (double negation) operator is used to explicitly
convert the value into a boolean. If a token exists in the localStorage,

                                  <!-- Pure Pipes: Stateless, efficient, and produce the same output for the same input. 
They are called only when the input value or parameters change.

Impure Pipes: Stateful or rely on external factors. They are recalculated on
every change detection cycle and are suitable for scenarios where
the transformation depends on mutable state or external factors. -->


                                  <!-- 
View Encapsulation: In Angular, view encapsulation refers to the way 
Angular scopes styles to the component's view. By default, Angular 
uses Emulated Encapsulation, which means each component's styles are
scoped to that component's view only. This prevents styles from
bleeding into other components. Angular also supports Shadow
DOM encapsulation and None (where styles are global).

ngBind: This term is more commonly associated with AngularJS (Angular 1.x).
It's a directive that binds the AngularJS application data to HTML tags.
In Angular (versions 2 and above), a similar functionality is achieved
using interpolation ({{}}) or property binding ([]).

Subject: In the context of Angular and RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript), 
a Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicasted to
many Observers. Subjects are both Observers and Observables.

concatMap, switchMap, mergeMap: These are operators provided by RxJS library for
handling asynchronous operations in Angular applications. They are used in 
combination with observables to manage the handling of asynchronous data.
Each has slightly different behavior:

concatMap: Maps each value to an observable, then flattens all of these inner
observables into a single observable, in a serialized manner. It waits for 
each inner observable to complete before moving to the next.

switchMap: Similar to concatMap, but it cancels previous subscriptions when
a new value arrives, switching to the new observable.

mergeMap: Maps each value to an observable, then flattens all of these inner
observables into a single observable, concurrently. It doesn't wait for inner
observables to complete before moving to the next.

Preprocessor CSS: This refers to a tool or language that extends CSS with variables, 
mixins, functions, and many other mechanisms. Popular preprocessors include Sass, LESS, 
and Stylus. In an Angular context, you can use preprocessors to write more maintainable
and modular CSS for your components.

Minify CSS: Minification is the process of reducing the size of CSS files By
removing unnecessary whitespace, comments, and renaming variables to shorter
names, without affecting the functionality of the code. This improves website
loading times by reducing file size. In an Angular context, you might use 
minification tools as part of your build process to optimize CSS files for production deployment. -->



<!-- Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) and SCSS (Sassy CSS) are both CSS preprocessors,
 meaning they extend the functionality of regular CSS by adding features like variables,
  nesting, mixins, inheritance, functions, and more. Let's compare them:

Sass:
Syntax: Sass has its own syntax, which is intended to be more concise and less
 cluttered than CSS. It uses indentation to define blocks of code and omits
  semicolons and curly braces.

Example:

sass
$primary-color: blue

.container
  width: 100%
  padding: 20px

  .btn
    background-color: $primary-color
    &:hover
      background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%)
File Extension: .sass

Features:

Shorter syntax
No curly braces or semicolons
Indentation-based
Limited compatibility with existing CSS
SCSS:
Syntax: SCSS (Sassy CSS) is an extension of CSS, meaning it has a syntax similar to
 CSS with some additional features. It uses curly braces, semicolons, and other CSS conventions.

Example:

scss

$primary-color: blue;

.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;

  .btn {
    background-color: $primary-color;
    &:hover {
      background-color: darken($primary-color, 10%);
    }
  }
}
File Extension: .scss

Features:

CSS-like syntax
Full compatibility with existing CSS
Familiarity to developers coming from traditional CSS
CSS:
Syntax: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the standard styling language for the web.
 It consists of a series of rulesets, each containing selectors and declarations.

Example:
<style>
css

.container {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 20px;
}

.container .btn {
  background-color: blue;
}

.container .btn:hover {
  background-color: darkblue;
}
</style>
File Extension: .css

Features:

Widely supported by browsers
No preprocessing required
Limited in terms of functionality compared to Sass/SCSS


After writing Sass code, it needs to be compiled into regular CSS so that 
browsers can understand it. You can use various tools for compilation, such as:

Command Line Tools: You can use the command line to compile Sass files. For example:
sass input.scss output.css -->
