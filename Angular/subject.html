    @ViewChild Decorator with myChildComponent
    Decorator: @ViewChild
    
    The @ViewChild decorator in Angular is used to query and get a reference to a child component,
     directive, or DOM element within the parent component. It allows the parent component to interact
    with the child component directly.
    
    Argument: ChildComponent
    
    The argument passed to @ViewChild is the type of the component or directive you want to query. 
    In this case, ChildComponent is the class of the child component that you want to reference.
    
    Variable: myChildComponent
    
    myChildComponent is the variable that will hold the reference to the instance of the ChildComponent. 
    By declaring this variable with @ViewChild, Angular will automatically populate it with the instance 
    of ChildComponent after the view is initialized.
    
    Type Assertion: !: ChildComponent;
    The !: ChildComponent; syntax is a TypeScript non-null assertion operator. It tells TypeScript that 
    myChildComponent will be assigned a value by Angular and it will not be null or undefined. This is 
    necessary because TypeScript’s strict null checks would otherwise consider this property as 
    potentially undefined.
    
    Step-by-Step Explanation
    
    Parent Component Definition:
    The parent component is defined with a @Component decorator that 
    specifies its metadata (selector, template, styles).
    
    Using @ViewChild:
    
    Inside the parent component class, the @ViewChild decorator is 
    used to declare a variable myChildComponent:
    
    @ViewChild(ChildComponent) myChildComponent!: ChildComponent;
    
    This tells Angular to look for an instance of ChildComponent within the parent component’s 
    template and assign it to the myChildComponent variable.
    
    Lifecycle Hook - ngAfterViewInit:
    Angular initializes the myChildComponent variable after the view initialization is complete. 
    This occurs in the ngAfterViewInit lifecycle hook.
    
    ngAfterViewInit(): void {
      // Now you can access the child component's properties and methods
      console.log(this.myChildComponent.childData);
      this.myChildComponent.someMethod();
    }
    
    At this point, this.myChildComponent is a reference to the actual instance of the ChildComponent 
    within the template. You can access its properties and methods just like you would with any other 
    object.
    
    Accessing Child Component Data and Methods:
    In the example, a button click event triggers the getDataFromChild method.
    
    getDataFromChild(): void {
      // Using ViewChild to get data from child component
      this.parentData = this.myChildComponent.getChildData();
    }
    
    
    
    This method uses the myChildComponent reference to call the getChildData method on the 
    ChildComponent instance. The returned data is then assigned to parentData, which can be used 
    within the parent component.
    
    Summary
    The @ViewChild(ChildComponent) myChildComponent!: ChildComponent; line tells Angular to find the 
    ChildComponent instance within the parent component's template and assign it to the myChildComponent 
    variable.
    
    The parent component can then use this reference to access the child component's properties and 
    methods, enabling communication and data sharing between the parent and child components.
    This setup is especially useful for scenarios where the parent component needs to interact with 
    or retrieve data from the child component after the child component has been initialized.
    
    Can We Say the Variable Will Hold the Child Component's Instance?
    
    Yes, we can say that the variable myChildComponent will hold the child component's instance. 
    After Angular initializes the view, myChildComponent will contain a reference to the actual 
    ChildComponent instance present in the template. This allows the parent component to directly 
    access and manipulate the child component’s properties and methods.
    
    
    
    //dataPassing using @output decorator
    //ChildComponent
    import { Component, EventEmitter, Output } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-child',
      template: `
        <button (click)="sendDataToParent()">Send Data to Parent</button>
      `
    })
    export class ChildComponent {
      @Output() dataEmitter = new EventEmitter<string>();
    
      childData: string = 'Hello from Child Component!';
    
      sendDataToParent(): void {
        this.dataEmitter.emit(this.childData);
      }
    }
    //parentComponent
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-parent',
      template: `
        <app-child (dataEmitter)="receiveData($event)"></app-child>
        <p>{{ parentData }}</p>
      `
    })
    export class ParentComponent {
      parentData: string = '';
    
      receiveData(data: string): void {
        this.parentData = data;
      }
    }
    
    
    Explanation:
    The child component uses the @Output decorator to define an EventEmitter.
    The sendDataToParent method emits the childData when a button is clicked.
    The parent component listens for the dataEmitter event using Angular’s event 
    binding syntax ((dataEmitter)="receiveData($event)").
    The parent component’s receiveData method handles the emitted data.
    
    Comparison
    @ViewChild: Best when the parent component needs to directly interact with the child component’s 
    properties and methods. It allows the parent component to fetch data on demand.
    
    @Output: Best when the child component needs to inform the parent component about data changes 
    or specific actions/events. It is more suitable for event-driven data communication and promotes
     loose coupling.



      
    //promises
    toPromise() Usage
    The toPromise() method is a function that converts an Observable into a Promise.
    
    import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';
    import { Component } from '@angular/core';
    
    @Component({
      selector: 'app-example',
      template: `<div *ngIf="data">{{ data }}</div>`
    })
    export class ExampleComponent {
      data: any;
    
      constructor(private http: HttpClient) {
        this.fetchData();
      }
    
      fetchData() {
        this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').toPromise()
          .then(response => {
            this.data = response;
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.error('Error fetching data', error);
          });
      }
    }
    
    In this example, this.http.get() returns an Observable, which is then converted into a Promise using toPromise(). 
    This allows us to use .then() and .catch() to handle the asynchronous data.
    
    Note
    As of RxJS 7, toPromise() is deprecated. Instead, you should use firstValueFrom() or lastValueFrom():
    
    import { firstValueFrom } from 'rxjs';
    
    this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').pipe(firstValueFrom())
      .then(response => {
        this.data = response;
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data', error);
      });
    
    //Promise.all waits for all of them to resolve and then provides an array of their results.
    
    const promise1 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data1').then(response => response.json());
    const promise2 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data2').then(response => response.json());
    const promise3 = fetch('https://api.example.com/data3').then(response => response.json());
    
    Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3])
      .then(responses => {
        const [data1, data2, data3] = responses;
        console.log('All data fetched:', data1, data2, data3);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      });
    //
    Key Points to Understand
    Immediate Rejection Handling: Promise.all() rejects as soon as any of the promises in the array rejects. 
    It does not wait for the other promises to complete.
    
    Ignored Results: Once a promise rejects, the results of any other pending promises are ignored. 
    If those promises eventually resolve or reject, their outcomes are not considered by 
    the Promise.all() that has already rejected.
    
    Handling rejections: To handle both rejections and fulfillments of multiple promises, use Promise.allSettled() instead.
    
    Differences and Use Cases
    
    toPromise(): Use this when you want to convert an Observable to a Promise.
    This is handy in Angular applications when dealing with libraries or legacy code that uses Promises.
    
    Promise.all(): Use this when you have multiple asynchronous operations that can be performed concurrently,
    and you want to wait for all of them to complete before proceeding. It helps in situations where you need 
    all pieces of data before rendering or performing some action.
    
    // Promise.allSettled()
    The syntax for Promise.allSettled() is
    Promise.allSettled(iterable);
    
    
    //example to understand how Promise.allSettled() works:
    
    
    const promise1 = Promise.resolve(42);
    const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(reject, 100, 'Timeout'));
    const promise3 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => setTimeout(resolve, 200, 'Resolved'));
    
    Promise.allSettled([promise1, promise2, promise3])
      .then(results => {
        results.forEach(result => {
          if (result.status === 'fulfilled') {
            console.log('Fulfilled:', result.value);
          } else {
            console.error('Rejected:', result.reason);
          }
        });
      });
    
    
    Handling Multiple Promises
    Handling Success and Failure: With Promise.allSettled(), you can handle both successful and failed promises in a single .then() handler. 
    This is particularly useful when you need to execute cleanup or logging operations based on the outcome of each promise.
    
    Non-Blocking: Unlike Promise.all(), Promise.allSettled() does not short-circuit on the first rejection. It waits for all 
    promises to resolve or reject before proceeding, making it suitable for scenarios where you need to know the status of every promise.
    
    Compatibility
    Promise.allSettled() is part of ECMAScript 2020 (ES2020) and is supported in modern browsers and Node.js versions that implement ES2020 features. 
    If you need to support older environments, consider using a polyfill or alternative techniques.
